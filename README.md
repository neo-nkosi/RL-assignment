# Grid Management with Reinforcement Learning

This project sets up a reinforcement learning environment using **Grid2Op** and **Stable Baselines3**. It includes custom environment wrappers and a training script utilizing **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** and **Deep-Q Networks (DQN)** to train agents for grid management scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have **Python** installed on your system.

### Installation
Install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install gymnasium
pip install shimmy
pip install grid2op
pip install lightsim2grid
pip install stable_baselines3
pip install numpy
pip install tensorboard
```
If you encounter compatibility errors, try installing the following specific versions:

```bash
pip install gymnasium==0.29
pip install shimmy==1.30
```
### Running Agent Evaluations
When running any of the evaluation files, please ensure that you run them from the `RL-Assignment` folder.
